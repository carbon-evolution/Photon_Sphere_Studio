# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## ✅ Completed Steps:

## 📝 Next Steps - Create GitHub Repository:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `Photon-Sphere-Studio` (or your choice)
3. **Description**: `3D Black Hole Visualization with Warped Spacetime Grid`
4. **Visibility**: Public
5. **Important**: DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   (we already have these files!)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show commands. Copy the repository URL, which looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Photon-Sphere-Studio.git
```

### Step 3: Provide the URL
Give me the repository URL, and I'll run these commands for you:
```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 📦 What Will Be Uploaded:
- README.md (comprehensive documentation with GIF animations)
- Photon_Sphere_3D.py (main visualization code)
- LICENSE (MIT)
- .gitignore
- requirements.txt
- photon_sphere_3d_full.gif (3D animation)

Ready to push once you provide the repository URL! 🚀
